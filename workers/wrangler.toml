# NOTE: We recommend using `wrangler secret put` to set the STRIPE key and SUPABASE keys.
# For example:
#   wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
#   wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
#   wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
#   wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET
# You can also add variables in the dashboard or under [vars] below.

[vars]
# SUPABASE_URL = "https://xyz.supabase.co"  # prefer to set in Cloudflare dashboard or via wrangler env
# MONITORING_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://hooks.example.com/your-monitor"
